            <li>Pinch of cream of tartar</li>
            <li>2 sticks unsalted butter, cut into pieces, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Assorted green sprinkles, for decorating</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350˚. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners. 
                Sift the cake flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. 
                Whisk the sugar, milk, vegetable oil, egg, vinegar and vanilla in a separate large bowl. 
                Whisk in the flour mixture until smooth. 
                Add the green food coloring and stir until combined.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling them three-quarters of the way. 
                Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 15 minutes. 
                Let cool slightly in the pan, then remove to a rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the frosting: Put the white chocolate in a small heatproof bowl set over 
                a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water). Cook, stirring, 
                until melted; remove the bowl from the pan and let cool slightly. 
                Reserve the pan of simmering water.</li>
            <li>Whisk the egg whites, sugar, salt and cream of tartar in a large heatproof bowl set over the pan 
                of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water). Cook, whisking, until the sugar 
                dissolves and the mixture registers 130˚ on a candy thermometer, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                Remove the bowl from the pan; beat with a mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                Reduce the mixer speed to medium and beat until the bowl is no longer warm, 1 to 2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Increase the mixer speed to medium high and continue beating, adding the butter one piece at a 
                time, until thick and combined. (The mixture might separate, but keep beating and it will smooth out.) 
                Add the melted white chocolate and vanilla and continue beating until just combined.</li>
            <li>Transfer the frosting to a resealable plastic bag and snip a corner. 
                Pipe onto the cupcakes and decorate with green sprinkles.</li>
        </ol>
