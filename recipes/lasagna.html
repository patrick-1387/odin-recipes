    <h1>Spinach Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="lasagna.jpg">
    <h3>This is the ultimate creamy, cheesy, spinach lasagna.
        This recipe works because saut√©ing the spinach instead of blanching or microwaving it 
        improves flavor, while chopping allows you to evenly incorporate it into every bite.
        A mixture of smoothly processed ricotta and ricotta that hasn't been in the food processor 
        gives the lasagna a creamy flavor while still maintaining the classic small curds of ricotta 
        in the finished dish. Stacks and stacks of fresh pasta make this dish about the pasta, not just the fillings.
